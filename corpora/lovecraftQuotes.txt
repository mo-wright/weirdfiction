                    by an Innsmouth fellow--Joe Sargent--but never gets any custom from here, or
                    Arkham either, I guess. Leaves the Square--front of Hammond's Drug Store--at 10
                    A.M. and 7 P.M. unless they've changed lately. Looks like a terrible
                    rattletrap--I've never been on it.""Innsmouth? Well, it's a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the Manuxet.
                    Used to be almost a city--quite a port before the War of 1812--but all gone to
                    pieces in the last hundred years or so. No railroad now--B. M. never went
                    through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago.More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak
                    of except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either here or in
                    Arkham or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing's left now
                    except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part
                time."That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns
                    it, must be richer'n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in
                    his home. He's supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in
                    life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who
                    founded the business. His mother seems to've been some kind of foreigner--they
                    say a South Sea islander--so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich
                    girl fifty years ago. They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here
                    and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in 'em. But
                    Marsh's children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so far's I can
                    see. I've had 'em pointed out to me here--though, come to think of it, the elder
                    children don't seem to be around lately. Never saw the old man.And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you mustn't
                    take too much stock in what people around here say. They're hard to get started,
                    but once they do get started they never let up. They've been telling things
                    about Innsmouth--whispering 'em, mostly--for the last hundred years, I guess,
                    and I gather they're more scared than anything else. Some of the stories would
                    make you laugh--about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and
                    bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of
                    devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people
                    stumbled on around 1845 or there-abouts--but I come from Panton, Vermont, and
                    that kind of story don't go down with me."You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black
                    reef off the coast--Devil Reef, they call it. It's well above water a good part
                    of the time, and never much below it, but at that you could hardly call it an
                    island. The story is that there's a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on
                    that reef--sprawled about, or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the
                    top. It's a rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end
                    of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it.That is, sailors that didn't hail from Innsmouth. One of the things they had
                    against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at
                    night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation
                    was interesting, and it's just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot
                    and maybe finding it; but there was talk of his dealing with demons there. Fact
                    is, I guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation
                    to the reef."That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks in
                    Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what the trouble was,
                    but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere
                    by the shipping. It surely was bad enough--there was riots over it, and all
                    sorts of ghastly doings that I don't believe ever got outside of town--and it
                    left the place in awful shape. Never came back--there can't be more'n 300 or 400
                    people living there now.But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice--and I
                    don't say I'm blaming those that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself,
                    and I wouldn't care to go to their town. I s'pose you know--though I can see
                    you're a Westerner by your talk--what a lot our New England ships used to have
                    to do with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and
                    what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with 'em. You've probably
                    heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe you know
                    there's still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere around Cape Cod."Well, there must be something like that back of the Innsmouth people. The
                    place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and
                    creeks, and we can't be sure about the ins and outs of the matter; but it's
                    pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought home some odd specimens
                    when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and
                    thirties. There certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the Innsmouth folks
                    today--I don't know how to explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl. You'll
                    notice a little in Sargent if you take his bus. Some of 'em have queer narrow
                    heads with flat noses and bulgy, starey eyes that never seem to shut, and their
                    skin ain't quite right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of their necks are all
                    shriveled or creased up. Get bald, too, very young. The older fellows look the
                    worst--fact is, I don't believe I've ever seen a very old chap of that kind.
                    Guess they must die of looking in the glass! Animals hate 'em--they used to have
                    lots of horse trouble before autos came in.Nobody can ever keep track of those people, and state school officials and
                    census men have a devil of a time. You can bet that prying strangers ain't
                    welcome around Innsmouth. I've heard personally of more'n one business or
                    government man that's disappeared there, and there's loose talk of one who went
                    crazy and is out at Danvers now. They must have fixed up some awful scare for
                    that fellow."That's why I wouldn't go at night if I was you. I've never been there and
                    have no wish to go, but I guess a daytime trip couldn't hurt you--even though
                    the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it. If you're just
                    sightseeing, and looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought to be quite a place
                    for you.""The Esoteric Order of Dagon,""Y""_Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb'port_""Innsmouth.""Esoteric Order of Dagon.""Innsmouth look""Hey,

                    prayers."Matt Eliot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin' folks's
                    doin' any heathen things. Told abaout an island east of Othaheite whar they was
                    a lot o' stone ruins older'n anybody knew anything abaout, kind o' like them on
                    Ponape, in the Carolines, but with carvin's of faces that looked like the big
                    statues on Easter Island. They was a little volcanic island near thar, too, whar
                    they was other ruins with diff'rent carvin's--ruins all wore away like they'd
                    ben under the sea onct, an' with picters of awful monsters all over 'em.Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud
                    ketch, an' sported bracelets an' armlets an' head rigs made aout of a queer kind
                    o' gold an' covered with picters o' monsters jest like the ones carved over the
                    ruins on the little island--sorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was
                    drawed in all kinds o' positions like they was human bein's. Nobody cud git aout
                    o' them whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow
                    they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean
                    pickin's. Matt he got to wonderin' too, an' so did Cap'n Obed. Obed, he notices,
                    besides, that lots of the han'some young folks ud drop aout o' sight fer good
                    from year to year, an' that they wan't many old folk araound. Also, he thinks
                    some of the folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys."It took Obed to git the truth aout o' them heathens. I dun't know haow he
                    done it, but he begun by tradin' fer the gold-like things they wore. Ast 'em
                    whar they come from, an' ef they cud git more, an' finally wormed the story aout
                    o' the old chief--Walakea, they called him. Nobody but Obed ud ever a believed
                    the old yeller devil, but the Cap'n cud read folks like they was books. Heh,
                    heh! Nobody never believes me naow when I tell 'em, an I dun't s'pose you will,
                    young feller--though come to look at ye, ye hev kind o' got them sharp-readin'
                    eyes like Obed had.""Wal, Sir, Obed he larnt that they's things on this arth as most folks never
                    heard abaout--an' wouldn't believe ef they did hear. It seems these Kanakys was
                    sacrificin' heaps o' their young men an' maidens to some kind o' god-things that
                    lived under the sea, an' gittin' all kinds o' favors in return. They met the
                    things on the little islet with the queer ruins, an' it seems them awful picters
                    o' frog-fish monsters was supposed to be picters o' these things. Mebbe they was
                    the kind o' critters as got all the mermaids stories an' sech started. They had
                    all kinds o' cities on the sea-bottom, an' this island was heaved up from thar.
                    Seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildin's when the island
                    come up sudden to the surface. That's haow the Kanakys got wind they was daown
                    thar. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over bein' skeert, an' pieced up a
                    bargain afore long.Them things liked human sacrifices. Had had 'em ages afore, but lost track o'
                    the upper world arter a time. What they done to the victims it ain't fer me to
                    say, an' I guess Obed wa'n't none too sharp abaout askin'. But it was all right
                    with the heathens, because they'd ben havin' a hard time an' was desp'rate
                    abaout everything. They give a sarten number o' young folks to the sea-things
                    twict every year--May-Eve an' Hallowe'en--reg'lar as cud be. Also give some o'
                    the carved knick-knacks they made. What the things agreed to give in return was
                    a plenty o' fish--they druv 'em in from all over the sea--an' a few gold-like
                    things naow an' then."When it come to matin' with them toad-lookin' fishes, the Kanakys kind o'
                    balked, but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter. Seems
                    that human folks has got a kind o' relation to sech water-beasts--that
                    everything alive come aout o' the water onct, an' only needs a little change to
                    go back agin. Them things told the Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there'd be
                    children as ud look human at fust, but later turn more'n more like the things,
                    till finally they'd take to the water an' jine the main lot o' things daown
                    thar. An' this is the important part, young feller--them as turned into fish
                    things an' went into the water _wouldn't never die_. Them things never died
                    excep' they was kilt violent.Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all full
                    o' fish blood from them deep-water things. When they got old an' begun to show
                    it, they was kep' hid until they felt like takin' to the water an' quittin' the
                    place. Some was more teched than others, an' some never did change quite enough
                    to take to the water; but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said.
                    Them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human
                    sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they'd usually
                    go daown under fer trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the water,
                    gen'rally come back a good deal to visit, so's a man ud often be a-talkin' to
                    his own five-times-great-grandfather, who'd left the dry land a couple o'
                    hundred years or so afore."Everybody got aout o' the idee o' dyin'--excep' in canoe wars with the other
                    islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea-gods daown below, or from snake-bite or
                    plague or sharp gallopin' ailments or somethin' afore they cud take to the
                    water--but simply looked forrad to a kind o' change that wa'n't a bit horrible
                    arter a while. They thought what they'd got was well wuth all they'd had to give
                    up--an' I guess Obed kind o' come to think the same hisself when he'd chewed
                    over old Walakea's story a bit. Walakea, though, was one of the few as hadn't
                    got none of the fish blood--bein' of a royal line that intermarried with royal
                    lines on other islands.Walakea give him a funny kind o' thingumajig made aout o' lead or something,
                    that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they
                    might be a nest of 'em. The idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o'
                    prayers an' sech. Walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the
                    world, so's anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an' bring 'em up ef they
                    was wanted."Matt he didn't like this business at all, an' wanted Obed shud keep away
                    from the island; but the Cap'n was sharp fer gain, an' faound he cud git them
                    gold-like things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of 'em.Things went on that way fer years, an' Obed got enough o' that gold-like
                    stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite's old run-daown fullin'
                    mill."Wall, come abaout 'thutty-eight--when I was seven year' old--Obed he faound
                    the island people all wiped aout between v'yages. Seems the other islanders had
                    got wind o' what was goin' on, an' had took matters into their own hands. S'pose
                    they must a had, arter all, them old magic signs as the sea things says was the
                    only things they was afeard of. No tellin' what any o' them Kanakys will chance
                    to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island with ruins older'n
                    the deluge. Pious cusses, these was--they didn't leave nothin' standin' on
                    either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep' what parts of the
                    ruins was too big to knock daown.That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein' as his normal trade was doin'
                    very poor. It hit the whole of Innsmouth, too, because in seafarin' days what
                    profited the master of a ship gen'lly profited the crew proportionate. Most o'
                    the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o' sheeplike an' resigned,
                    but they was in bad shape because the fishin' was peterin' aout an' the mills
                    wa'n't doin' none too well."Then's the time Obed he begun a-cursin' at the folks fer bein' dull sheep
                    an' prayin' to a Christian heaven as didn't help 'em none. He told 'em he'd
                    knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin' ye reely need, an' says ef
                    a good bunch o' men ud stand by him, he cud mebbe git a holt o' sarten paowers
                    as ud bring plenty o' fish an' quite a bit o' gold.""Poor Matt--Matt he allus was agin it--tried to line up the folks on his
                    side, an' had long talks with the preachers--no use--they run the Congregational
                    parson aout o' taown, an' the Methodist feller quit--never did see Resolved

                    Cap'n Obed an' twenty odd other folks used to row aout to Devil Reef in the dead
                    o' night an' chant things so laoud ye cud hear 'em all over taown when the wind
                    was right? Tell me that, hey? An' tell me why Obed was allus droppin' heavy
                    things daown into the deep water t'other side o' the reef whar the bottom shoots
                    daown like a cliff lower'n ye kin saound? Tell me what he done with that
                    funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy?""Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginnin' to see, hey? Haow abaout the night I took my
                    pa's ship's glass up to a cupalo an' seed the reef a-bristlin' thick with shapes
                    that dove off quick soon's the moon riz? Obed an' the folks was in a dory, but
                    them shapes dove off the far side into the deep water an' never come up....
                    Haow'd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo a-watchin' shapes _as
                    wa'n't human shapes_?... Hey?... Heh, heh, heh, heh....""S'pose one night ye seed somethin' heavy heaved offen Obed's dory beyond the
                    reef, an' then larned nex' day a young feller was missin' from home? Hey? Did
                    anybody ever see hide or hair o' Hiram Gilman agin? Did they? An' Nick Pierce,
                    an' Luelly Waite, an' Adoniram Saouthwick, an' Henry Garrison? Hey? Heh, heh....
                Wal, Sir, that was the time Obed begun to git on his feet agin. Folks see his
                    three darters a-wearin' gold-like things as nobody'd never see on 'em afore, an'
                    smoke started comin' aout o' the refin'ry chimbly. Other folks was prosp'rin',
                    too--fish began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill, an' heaven knows what
                    sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to Newb'ryport, Arkham, an' Boston. 'Twas
                    then Obed got the ol' branch railrud put through."Remember, I ain't sayin' Obed was set on hevin' things jest like they was on
                    that Kanaky isle. I dun't think he aimed at fust to do no mixin', nor raise no
                    young-uns to take to the water an' turn into fishes with etarnal life. He wanted
                    them gold things, an' was willin' to pay heavy, an' I guess the _others_ was
                    satisfied fer a while....Come in 'forty-six the taown done some lookin' an' thinkin' fer itself. Too
                    many folks missin'--too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a Sunday--too much
                    talk abaout that reef. I guess I done a bit by tellin' Selectman Mowry what I
                    see from the cupalo. They was a party one night as follered Obed's craowd aout
                    to the reef, an' I heerd shots betwixt the dories. Nex' day Obed an' thutty-two
                    others was in jail, with everybody a-wonderin' jest what was afoot an' jest what
                    charge agin 'em cud be got to holt. God, ef anybody'd looked ahead ... a couple
                    o' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that
                    long....That awful night.... I seed 'em.... I was up in the cupalo ... hordes of 'em
                    ... swarms of 'em ... all over the reef an' swimmin' up the harbor into the
                    Manuxet.... God, what happened in the streets of Innsmouth that night ... they
                    rattled our door, but pa wouldn't open ... then he clumb aout the kitchen winder
                    with his musket to find Selectman Mowry an' see what he cud do.... Maounds o'

                    one didn't feel baound to stop 'em. Far gone, was Obed ... jest like a crazy man
                    on the subjeck. He says they brung us fish an' treasure, an' shud hev what they
                    hankered arter..."Nothin' was to be diff'runt on the aoutside, only we was to keep shy o'

                    under the sea in a phosphorescent, many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of
                    strange, leprous corals.--the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek In the

                than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing for height of plateau.
                Probable Latitude 76° 15´, Longitude 113° 10´ E. Reaches far as can see to right and
                left. Suspicion of two smoking cones. All peaks black and bare of snow. Gale blowing
                off them impedes navigation.Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt and perhaps
                can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further moves if
                necessary, but no more heavy plane travel needed just now. Mountains surpass
                anything in imagination. Am going up scouting in Carroll's plane, with all weight
                out."You can't imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over thirty-five
                thousand feet. Everest out of the running, Atwood to work out height with theodolite
                while Carroll and I go up. Probably wrong about cones, for formations look
                stratified. Possibly pre-Cambrian slate with other strata mixed in. Queer sky line
                effects--regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole thing marvelous
                in red-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or gateway to
                forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to study.""Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don't dare try really tall peaks in
                present weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing, and hard going at this
                altitude, but worth it. Great range fairly solid, hence can't get any glimpses
                beyond. Main summits exceed Himalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian
                slate, with plain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about volcanism.
                Goes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow above about
                twenty-one thousand feet. Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square blocks with
                exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low, vertical ramparts, like the
                old Asian castles clinging to steep mountains in Roerich's paintings. Impressive
                from distance. Flew close to some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller
                separate pieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and rounded
                off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years."Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored rock than any
                visible strata on slopes proper, hence an evidently crystalline origin. Close flying
                shows many cave mouths, some unusually regular in outline, square or semicircular.
                You must come and investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one peak.
                Height seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up twenty-one
                thousand five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing cold. Wind whistles and pipes
                through passes and in and out of caves, but no flying danger so far.""_I've got to dissect one of these things

                    by an Innsmouth fellow--Joe Sargent--but never gets any custom from here, or

                    A.M. and 7 P.M. unless they've changed lately. Looks like a terrible
                    rattletrap--I've never been on it.""Innsmouth? Well, it's a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the Manuxet.
                    Used to be almost a city--quite a port before the War of 1812--but all gone to
                    pieces in the last hundred years or so. No railroad now--B. M. never went
                    through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago.More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak
                    of except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either here or in
                    Arkham or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing's left now
                    except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part
                time."That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns
                    it, must be richer'n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in
                    his home. He's supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in
                    life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who
                    founded the business. His mother seems to've been some kind of foreigner--they
                    say a South Sea islander--so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich
                    girl fifty years ago. They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here
                    and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in 'em. But
                    Marsh's children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so far's I can
                    see. I've had 'em pointed out to me here--though, come to think of it, the elder
                    children don't seem to be around lately. Never saw the old man.And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you mustn't
                    take too much stock in what people around here say. They're hard to get started,
                    but once they do get started they never let up. They've been telling things
                    about Innsmouth--whispering 'em, mostly--for the last hundred years, I guess,
                    and I gather they're more scared than anything else. Some of the stories would
                    make you laugh--about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and
                    bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of
                    devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people
                    stumbled on around 1845 or there-abouts--but I come from Panton, Vermont, and
                    that kind of story don't go down with me."You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black
                    reef off the coast--Devil Reef, they call it. It's well above water a good part
                    of the time, and never much below it, but at that you could hardly call it an
                    island. The story is that there's a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on
                    that reef--sprawled about, or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the
                    top. It's a rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end
                    of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it.That is, sailors that didn't hail from Innsmouth. One of the things they had
                    against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at
                    night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation
                    was interesting, and it's just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot
                    and maybe finding it; but there was talk of his dealing with demons there. Fact
                    is, I guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation
                    to the reef."That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks in
                    Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what the trouble was,
                    but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere
                    by the shipping. It surely was bad enough--there was riots over it, and all
                    sorts of ghastly doings that I don't believe ever got outside of town--and it
                    left the place in awful shape. Never came back--there can't be more'n 300 or 400
                    people living there now.But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice--and I
                    don't say I'm blaming those that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself,
                    and I wouldn't care to go to their town. I s'pose you know--though I can see
                    you're a Westerner by your talk--what a lot our New England ships used to have
                    to do with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and
                    what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with 'em. You've probably
                    heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe you know
                    there's still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere around Cape Cod."Well, there must be something like that back of the Innsmouth people. The
                    place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and
                    creeks, and we can't be sure about the ins and outs of the matter; but it's
                    pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought home some odd specimens
                    when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and
                    thirties. There certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the Innsmouth folks
                    today--I don't know how to explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl. You'll
                    notice a little in Sargent if you take his bus. Some of 'em have queer narrow
                    heads with flat noses and bulgy, starey eyes that never seem to shut, and their
                    skin ain't quite right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of their necks are all
                    shriveled or creased up. Get bald, too, very young. The older fellows look the
                    worst--fact is, I don't believe I've ever seen a very old chap of that kind.
                    Guess they must die of looking in the glass! Animals hate 'em--they used to have
                    lots of horse trouble before autos came in.Nobody can ever keep track of those people, and state school officials and
                    census men have a devil of a time. You can bet that prying strangers ain't
                    welcome around Innsmouth. I've heard personally of more'n one business or
                    government man that's disappeared there, and there's loose talk of one who went
                    crazy and is out at Danvers now. They must have fixed up some awful scare for
                    that fellow."That's why I wouldn't go at night if I was you. I've never been there and
                    have no wish to go, but I guess a daytime trip couldn't hurt you--even though
                    the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it. If you're just
                    sightseeing, and looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought to be quite a place
                    for you.""The Esoteric Order of Dagon,""Y""_Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb'port_""Innsmouth.""Esoteric Order of Dagon.""Innsmouth look""Hey,
                        Mister!""Thar's whar it all begun--that cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep

                    fishin' in return fer their sacrifices, an' ud reely answer folks's
                    prayers."Matt Eliot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin' folks's
                    doin' any heathen things. Told abaout an island east of Othaheite whar they was
                    a lot o' stone ruins older'n anybody knew anything abaout, kind o' like them on
                    Ponape, in the Carolines, but with carvin's of faces that looked like the big
                    statues on Easter Island. They was a little volcanic island near thar, too, whar
                    they was other ruins with diff'rent carvin's--ruins all wore away like they'd
                    ben under the sea onct, an' with picters of awful monsters all over 'em.Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud
                    ketch, an' sported bracelets an' armlets an' head rigs made aout of a queer kind
                    o' gold an' covered with picters o' monsters jest like the ones carved over the
                    ruins on the little island--sorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was
                    drawed in all kinds o' positions like they was human bein's. Nobody cud git aout
                    o' them whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow
                    they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean
                    pickin's. Matt he got to wonderin' too, an' so did Cap'n Obed. Obed, he notices,
                    besides, that lots of the han'some young folks ud drop aout o' sight fer good
                    from year to year, an' that they wan't many old folk araound. Also, he thinks
                    some of the folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys."It took Obed to git the truth aout o' them heathens. I dun't know haow he
                    done it, but he begun by tradin' fer the gold-like things they wore. Ast 'em
                    whar they come from, an' ef they cud git more, an' finally wormed the story aout
                    o' the old chief--Walakea, they called him. Nobody but Obed ud ever a believed
                    the old yeller devil, but the Cap'n cud read folks like they was books. Heh,
                    heh! Nobody never believes me naow when I tell 'em, an I dun't s'pose you will,
                    young feller--though come to look at ye, ye hev kind o' got them sharp-readin'
                    eyes like Obed had.""Wal, Sir, Obed he larnt that they's things on this arth as most folks never
                    heard abaout--an' wouldn't believe ef they did hear. It seems these Kanakys was
                    sacrificin' heaps o' their young men an' maidens to some kind o' god-things that
                    lived under the sea, an' gittin' all kinds o' favors in return. They met the
                    things on the little islet with the queer ruins, an' it seems them awful picters
                    o' frog-fish monsters was supposed to be picters o' these things. Mebbe they was
                    the kind o' critters as got all the mermaids stories an' sech started. They had
                    all kinds o' cities on the sea-bottom, an' this island was heaved up from thar.
                    Seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildin's when the island
                    come up sudden to the surface. That's haow the Kanakys got wind they was daown
                    thar. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over bein' skeert, an' pieced up a
                    bargain afore long.Them things liked human sacrifices. Had had 'em ages afore, but lost track o'
                    the upper world arter a time. What they done to the victims it ain't fer me to
                    say, an' I guess Obed wa'n't none too sharp abaout askin'. But it was all right
                    with the heathens, because they'd ben havin' a hard time an' was desp'rate
                    abaout everything. They give a sarten number o' young folks to the sea-things
                    twict every year--May-Eve an' Hallowe'en--reg'lar as cud be. Also give some o'
                    the carved knick-knacks they made. What the things agreed to give in return was
                    a plenty o' fish--they druv 'em in from all over the sea--an' a few gold-like
                    things naow an' then."When it come to matin' with them toad-lookin' fishes, the Kanakys kind o'
                    balked, but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter. Seems
                    that human folks has got a kind o' relation to sech water-beasts--that
                    everything alive come aout o' the water onct, an' only needs a little change to
                    go back agin. Them things told the Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there'd be
                    children as ud look human at fust, but later turn more'n more like the things,
                    till finally they'd take to the water an' jine the main lot o' things daown
                    thar. An' this is the important part, young feller--them as turned into fish
                    things an' went into the water _wouldn't never die_. Them things never died
                    excep' they was kilt violent.Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all full
                    o' fish blood from them deep-water things. When they got old an' begun to show
                    it, they was kep' hid until they felt like takin' to the water an' quittin' the
                    place. Some was more teched than others, an' some never did change quite enough
                    to take to the water; but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said.
                    Them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human
                    sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they'd usually
                    go daown under fer trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the water,
                    gen'rally come back a good deal to visit, so's a man ud often be a-talkin' to
                    his own five-times-great-grandfather, who'd left the dry land a couple o'
                    hundred years or so afore."Everybody got aout o' the idee o' dyin'--excep' in canoe wars with the other
                    islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea-gods daown below, or from snake-bite or
                    plague or sharp gallopin' ailments or somethin' afore they cud take to the
                    water--but simply looked forrad to a kind o' change that wa'n't a bit horrible
                    arter a while. They thought what they'd got was well wuth all they'd had to give
                    up--an' I guess Obed kind o' come to think the same hisself when he'd chewed
                    over old Walakea's story a bit. Walakea, though, was one of the few as hadn't
                    got none of the fish blood--bein' of a royal line that intermarried with royal
                    lines on other islands.Walakea give him a funny kind o' thingumajig made aout o' lead or something,
                    that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they
                    might be a nest of 'em. The idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o'
                    prayers an' sech. Walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the
                    world, so's anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an' bring 'em up ef they
                    was wanted."Matt he didn't like this business at all, an' wanted Obed shud keep away
                    from the island; but the Cap'n was sharp fer gain, an' faound he cud git them
                    gold-like things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of 'em.Things went on that way fer years, an' Obed got enough o' that gold-like
                    stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite's old run-daown fullin'
                    mill."Wall, come abaout 'thutty-eight--when I was seven year' old--Obed he faound
                    the island people all wiped aout between v'yages. Seems the other islanders had
                    got wind o' what was goin' on, an' had took matters into their own hands. S'pose
                    they must a had, arter all, them old magic signs as the sea things says was the
                    only things they was afeard of. No tellin' what any o' them Kanakys will chance
                    to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island with ruins older'n
                    the deluge. Pious cusses, these was--they didn't leave nothin' standin' on
                    either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep' what parts of the
                    ruins was too big to knock daown.That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein' as his normal trade was doin'
                    very poor. It hit the whole of Innsmouth, too, because in seafarin' days what
                    profited the master of a ship gen'lly profited the crew proportionate. Most o'
                    the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o' sheeplike an' resigned,
                    but they was in bad shape because the fishin' was peterin' aout an' the mills
                    wa'n't doin' none too well."Then's the time Obed he begun a-cursin' at the folks fer bein' dull sheep
                    an' prayin' to a Christian heaven as didn't help 'em none. He told 'em he'd
                    knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin' ye reely need, an' says ef
                    a good bunch o' men ud stand by him, he cud mebbe git a holt o' sarten paowers
                    as ud bring plenty o' fish an' quite a bit o' gold.""Poor Matt--Matt he allus was agin it--tried to line up the folks on his
                    side, an' had long talks with the preachers--no use--they run the Congregational
                    parson aout o' taown, an' the Methodist feller quit--never did see Resolved
                    Babcock, the Baptist parson, agin--Wrath o' Jehovy--I was a mighty little
                    critter, but I heerd what I heerd an' seen what I seen--Dagon an'
                    Ashtoreth--Belial an' Beëlzebub--Golden Caff an' the idols o' Canaan an' the
                    Philistines--Babylonish abominations--_Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin_--""Dun't believe me, hey? Heh, heh, heh--then just tell me, young feller, why
                    Cap'n Obed an' twenty odd other folks used to row aout to Devil Reef in the dead
                    o' night an' chant things so laoud ye cud hear 'em all over taown when the wind
                    was right? Tell me that, hey? An' tell me why Obed was allus droppin' heavy
                    things daown into the deep water t'other side o' the reef whar the bottom shoots
                    daown like a cliff lower'n ye kin saound? Tell me what he done with that
                    funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy?""Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginnin' to see, hey? Haow abaout the night I took my
                    pa's ship's glass up to a cupalo an' seed the reef a-bristlin' thick with shapes
                    that dove off quick soon's the moon riz? Obed an' the folks was in a dory, but
                    them shapes dove off the far side into the deep water an' never come up....
                    Haow'd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo a-watchin' shapes _as
                    wa'n't human shapes_?... Hey?... Heh, heh, heh, heh....""S'pose one night ye seed somethin' heavy heaved offen Obed's dory beyond the
                    reef, an' then larned nex' day a young feller was missin' from home? Hey? Did
                    anybody ever see hide or hair o' Hiram Gilman agin? Did they? An' Nick Pierce,
                    an' Luelly Waite, an' Adoniram Saouthwick, an' Henry Garrison? Hey? Heh, heh....
                Wal, Sir, that was the time Obed begun to git on his feet agin. Folks see his
                    three darters a-wearin' gold-like things as nobody'd never see on 'em afore, an'
                    smoke started comin' aout o' the refin'ry chimbly. Other folks was prosp'rin',
                    too--fish began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill, an' heaven knows what
                    sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to Newb'ryport, Arkham, an' Boston. 'Twas
                    then Obed got the ol' branch railrud put through."Remember, I ain't sayin' Obed was set on hevin' things jest like they was on
                    that Kanaky isle. I dun't think he aimed at fust to do no mixin', nor raise no
                    young-uns to take to the water an' turn into fishes with etarnal life. He wanted
                    them gold things, an' was willin' to pay heavy, an' I guess the _others_ was
                    satisfied fer a while....Come in 'forty-six the taown done some lookin' an' thinkin' fer itself. Too
                    many folks missin'--too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a Sunday--too much
                    talk abaout that reef. I guess I done a bit by tellin' Selectman Mowry what I
                    see from the cupalo. They was a party one night as follered Obed's craowd aout
                    to the reef, an' I heerd shots betwixt the dories. Nex' day Obed an' thutty-two
                    others was in jail, with everybody a-wonderin' jest what was afoot an' jest what
                    charge agin 'em cud be got to holt. God, ef anybody'd looked ahead ... a couple
                    o' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that
                    long....That awful night.... I seed 'em.... I was up in the cupalo ... hordes of 'em
                    ... swarms of 'em ... all over the reef an' swimmin' up the harbor into the
                    Manuxet.... God, what happened in the streets of Innsmouth that night ... they
                    rattled our door, but pa wouldn't open ... then he clumb aout the kitchen winder
                    with his musket to find Selectman Mowry an' see what he cud do.... Maounds o'
                    the dead an' the dyin' ... shots an' screams ... shaoutin' in Ol' Squar an'
                    Taown Squar an' New Church Green ... jail throwed open ... proclamation ...
                    treason ... called it the plague when folks come in an' faound haff our people
                    missin' ... nobody left but them as ud jine in with Obed an' them things or else
                    keep quiet ... never heerd o' my pa no more...."Everything cleaned up in the mornin'--but they was _traces_.... Obed he
                    kinder takes charge an' says things is goin' to be changed ... _others'll_
                    worship with us at meetin'-time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertain
                    _guests_ ... _they_ wanted to mix like they done with the Kanakys, an' he fer
                    one didn't feel baound to stop 'em. Far gone, was Obed ... jest like a crazy man
                    on the subjeck. He says they brung us fish an' treasure, an' shud hev what they
                    hankered arter..."Nothin' was to be diff'runt on the aoutside, only we was to keep shy o'
                    strangers ef we knowed what was good fer us. We all hed to take the Oath o'
                    Dagon, an' later on they was secon' an' third Oaths that some of us took. Them
                    as ud help special, ud git special rewards--gold an' sech. No use balkin', fer
                    they was millions of 'em daown thar. They'd ruther not start risin' an' wipin'
