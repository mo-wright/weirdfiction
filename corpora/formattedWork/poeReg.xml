            <s> In the most rugged of wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure
                nature—there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent to
                reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.</s>
            <s> Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to be
                brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art—to
                form an intermedium between the two:—let us imagine, for example, a landscape whose
                combined vastness and definitiveness—whose united beauty, magnificence, and
                strangeness, shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the
                part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is
                preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or
                secondary nature—a nature which is not God, nor an emanation from God, but which
                still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man
                and God.</s>
