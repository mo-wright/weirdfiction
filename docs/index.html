        <h1> About Our Project </h1>

        <p> For our project, we’re diving into a comparative analysis of two influential horror writers:
            <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2148/pg2148.txt"> Edgar Allan Poe </a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68236/pg68236.txt"> H.P. Lovecraft </a>. Our goal is to explore the stylistic and thematic elements that
            define their respective approaches to horror—Poe’s rooted in gothic terror, and Lovecraft’s steeped in
            cosmic/eldritch horror. While their styles differ, their works often get discussed in tandem, making them
            a compelling pair for comparison.

            We’ve decided to focus on these two authors in part because of their public domain status, which allows us to
            easily build a clean, accessible corpus using texts from Project Gutenberg (Poe) and Lovecraft’s works.
            This not only streamlines our data gathering process but also lets us avoid any copyright issues. Once we’ve assembled our corpora, we'll analyze and compare: </P>

<ul class="list">

 <li> Word and phrase frequency, with particular focus on adjective usage</li>

<li> Lexical overlaps and differences </li>

<li> Sentence lengths and use of establishing phrases to determine pacing  </li>

  <li> The concept of 'vague language' in a suspense context </li>
</ul>

<p> These elements can reveal a lot about how each author builds suspense and tension in their writing.
    We're especially interested in how these structural choices affect the reader’s experience of horror.
 Later on, as we hit project milestones, we'll divvy up tasks more formally,
    but for now, setting our direction and getting inspiration is key!

We’re excited to see what patterns emerge through our analysis—and what surprises we might uncover along the way.</p>

            <p> Hello, I'm Molly! I'm a soon-to-be sophomore working towards a Bachelor's in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology. My interests are mostly in art and design, but learning more about programming has been fascinating!
                In my spare time, I love to do digital illustration, read, and listen to music - you can find me at pretty much any local rock gig.</p>

                Hi! I'm Chelsea, a senior full-time student currently obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Digital Media Arts and Technology.
                After graduation, I plan to continue my education at UNLV to pursue my Master's degree.
                I have a passion for travel and love spending time outdoors whenever I can.
                When I'm not studying or adventuring outside, you’ll probably find me playing
                video games or watching horror films — two of my favorite pastimes!
