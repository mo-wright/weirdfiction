        <h1> About Our Project </h1>

        <p> For our project, we’re diving into a comparative analysis of two influential horror writers:
            <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2148/pg2148.txt"> Edgar Allan Poe </a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68236/pg68236.txt"> H.P. Lovecraft </a>. Our goal is to explore the stylistic and thematic elements that
            define their respective approaches to horror—Poe’s rooted in gothic terror, and Lovecraft’s steeped in
            cosmic/eldritch horror. While their styles differ, their works often get discussed in tandem, making them
            a compelling pair for comparison.

            We’ve decided to focus on these two authors in part because of their public domain status, which allows us to
            easily build a clean, accessible corpus using texts from Project Gutenberg (Poe) and Lovecraft’s works.
            This not only streamlines our data gathering process but also lets us avoid any copyright issues. Once we’ve assembled our corpora, we'll analyze and compare: </P>

<ul class="list">

 <li> Word and phrase frequency</li>

<li> Lexical overlaps and differences </li>

<li> Paragraph and sentence lengths </li>

  <li>   Chapter structure and pacing </li>
</ul>

<p> These elements can reveal a lot about how each author builds suspense and tension in their writing.
    We're especially interested in how these structural choices affect the reader’s experience of horror.
 Later on, as we hit project milestones, we'll divvy up tasks more formally,
    but for now, setting our direction and getting inspiration is key!

We’re excited to see what patterns emerge through our analysis—and what surprises we might uncover along the way.</p>
